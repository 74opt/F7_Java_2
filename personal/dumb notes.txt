Bring minigames from F7 as combat maneuvers (increasing dodge, crit (or damage if no crit), and health regen)
    Make medkits give health over time rather than all at once (should i?)

Introduce random crits

Try implementing different zones

Try implementing crafting

If crafting, enemies will drop parts

Try adding skill tree and skill points 

Damage types + weaknesses/strength
(Inspired by warframe/pokemon)
    Do like warframe and have different health types and damage types
    Or like pokemon and have different types (easier and probably much better)

Make arraylist for each crafting material as storage

find way to make shields utilize levels

Make each enemy inherit from the Enemy class (so they can do fun special thingamajigs)
    should i do same with weapons? because yknow fun stuff!
    and consumables too! (might not actually hm)

individual weapon upgrading (like attachments).

in VSCode you can F1 and use "Format Document With" so that you get nice pretty formatting instead of dumb ugly formatting
