## Unit 7: ArrayList

- [x] Uses the generic type ArrayList\<E>, where the generic type E specifies the type of the elements.
- [ ] Uses the raw type ArrayList.
- [x] Imports the java.util package.
- [ ] Both calls and uses the return value (if non-void) of each of the following ArrayList methods:
  - [x] int size()
  - [x] boolean add(E obj)
  - [ ] void add(int index, E obj)
  - [x] E get(int index)
  - [x] E set(int index, E obj)
  - [ ] E remove(int index)
- [x] Uses iteration to traverse an ArrayList
- [ ] Deletes an element of an ArrayList during traversal without skipping an element.
- [x] Throws no ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions.
- [x] Throws no ConcurrentModificationExceptions.
- [ ] Checks each element in an ArrayList  in order until a desired value is found or all elements in the ArrayList have been checked.
- [x] Uses selection sort.
- [x] Uses insertion sort.
- [ ] Compares selection and insertion sort with statement execution counts.
- [x] Safeguards personal privacy.
- [x] Benefits personal security.

## Unit 8: 2D Array

- [x] Uses 2D arrays of object references.
- [x] Uses an initializer list to create a 2D array.
- [ ] Uses both row-major order and column-major order to traverse 2D arrays.
- [x] Uses nested iteration to traverse 2D arrays.
- [x] Uses enhanced for loops to traverse 2D arrays.

## Unit 9: Inheritance

- [x] Uses a subclass that extends a superclass.
- [x] Calls a superclass constructor with the super keyword and passes actual parameters.
- [ ] Calls a superclassâ€™s no-argument constructor.
- [ ] Calls the Object constructor.
- [x] Overrides methods in a superclass.
- [ ] Includes subclasses with instance variables.
- [ ] Calls an inherited method.
- [ ] Calls a superclass method with the super keyword and passes actual parameters.
- [ ] Facilitates polymorphism, i.e. assigns an object of a subclass to a reference of a superclass.
- [ ] Uses a method that takes an object of a superclass as a parameter but passes an object of a subclass.
- [ ] Uses an array of superclass object references but populates it with subclass object references.
- [ ] Uses an ArrayList of superclass object references but populates it with subclass object references.
- [ ] Overrides the toString and equals methods for all subclasses.
