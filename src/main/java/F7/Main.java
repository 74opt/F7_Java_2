TODO (Ordered by importance):
    - Make the DeathMenu and WinMenu much better please (make sure to unshit code)
        - You deadass forgot to implement the player actually dying
        - Probably should have them in the same class as CombatMenu2
            - Rename to just CombatMenu?
    - Networking 
        - Good resource even though it's for unity: https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/docs/learn/introduction
        - Set options for multiplayer and singleplayer
        - Networking works with a listen server, a player is host and others join
            - Peer to peer also seems cool but many downsides
        - Server menu?
            - Detect all servers running and put them into an arraylist
                - Sort by latency
                - Good chance to use arraylist methods
        - Option to join or host
            - When hosting, check all available servers first to make sure port is not already taken
        - Need a set tickrate (ScheduledExecutorService?)
    - Inheritance (check dumb notes)
    - You can finally have records again
